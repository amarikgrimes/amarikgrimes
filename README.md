Hi! My name is Amari Grimes. I am a Computer Science major, Game Development and Design Minor at Spelman College. I have just gotten started on this path somewhat but I am learning at a fast rate and I am ready to put some of my skills into practice. /n
I am interested in becoming a game developer and creating games I love and can play with my friends until I'm well into my old age! I have always had a great love for video games since I was a child and I never thought I would be able to bring that passion into my job and love what I do, but here I am!
I am looking for internships in the gaming and technology field and I would love to get experience before I graduate and am thrown into the big world of technology right now.
