Hi! My name is Amari Grimes. I am a recent Spelman College graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I have just gotten started on this path somewhat but I am learning at a fast rate and I am ready to put some of my skills into practice.
I am interested in becoming a game developer and creating games I love and can play with my friends until I'm well into my old age! I have always had a great love for video games since I was a child and I never thought I would be able to bring that passion into my job and love what I do, but here I am!
I am looking for jobs in the gaming and technology field and I would love to get professional experience as I was unable to get an internship during my college time.
